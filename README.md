**Document Query System with RAG Capabilities
This project is a Document Query System that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles to enable intelligent querying of uploaded documents. Users can upload documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.), which are then parsed and indexed. The system processes these documents and allows users to query them interactively to retrieve relevant answers.

Features
Multi-format Upload Support: Users can upload documents in PDF, DOCX, and other popular formats.
Document Parsing: Extracts text from uploaded documents while maintaining structure for effective querying.
RAG-inspired System: Combines retrieval techniques with generation for intelligent and context-aware responses.
Interactive Query Interface: Users can input queries, and the system fetches precise, relevant answers from the uploaded documents.
Efficient Search: Uses advanced search techniques to ensure accurate and fast retrieval of relevant information.
Customizable: Modular design allows easy extension or integration with other tools like OpenAI or Hugging Face for enhanced capabilities.

How It Works:
Upload Documents: Users can upload one or more documents in supported formats.
Parse Content: The system extracts the textual content from the uploaded files and preprocesses it for efficient retrieval.
Query Handling:
The user submits a query.
The system retrieves relevant sections from the parsed content.
It uses these sections to generate a precise answer.
Display Results: The response is displayed to the user, along with the context (relevant document sections).
